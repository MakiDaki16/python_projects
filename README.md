For PYTHON 3.12

Click on code and then on download zip to download my Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius calculator
Please check out my project and give me some feedback.
I am pretty new to programming and I am 13 years old.

The program will always repeat after it successfully calculated your number into °F or °C
The program will crash if you try to use letters or other symbols instead of numbers.

Everyone can use this calculator but please give me credits if you show it to other people or post it on social media

I hope everyone finds this program useful :)
